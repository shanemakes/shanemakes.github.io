An ordered list. I can prove it,\ntoo: check out this site and this one and [this\nsite][linkref]. Totally credible!\n\nWhen the dog barks\nWhen the bee stings\nWhen I'm feeling sad\n    I simply remember my favorite things\n    And then I don't feel...\n...So bad\n\n Equations and Math Typesetting\n\nI use MathJax/LaTeX to write some compelling equations. For instance, consider\nthe $Q$-learning model for a simple aircraft avoidance problem:\n\ndiv\n\\begin{align*}\nQ^* (b,a{+1}) &= R(b, a{+1}) + \\gamma \\sum_{b'} T(s' | s,a)U^* (s') \\\\\n&= \\sum{s} R(s,a)b(s) + \\gamma \\sum{s'} T(s' | s,a)U^* (s') \\\\\n&= R(s) +  R(a{+1}) + \\gamma \\sum{s'} T(s' | s,a)U^* (s')\n\\end{align*}\n/div\n\nSubsubsection to demonstrate tables\n\nSince we are certain that $h = 10$, and we chose action $a_{+1}$, then $\\hat{h} = 10$. We have the following possibilities for the next state:\n\nh      | t     | r   | $T(s' \\vert s,a)$\n-------|-------|-----|-----------\n10     | 0     | 1   | 0.5 + 0.25\n9      | 0     | 1   | 0.25\n\n Figures and Images\n\nI can either directly include an image without a caption, or make a 'figure'\nthat includes a caption. The figure is created using the shortcode syntax \nprovided by Hugo.\n\nHere is an image included with the default Markdown syntax:\n\nHere is a figure with a caption and title:\n\n{{ figure src=\"/img/beautiful_mountains.png\" caption=\"A screenshot of my lovely Desktop\" title=\"Screenshot\" }}\n\nEmbedded Videos\n\nI can also easily embed YouTube videos with a shortcode.\n\n{{ youtube dQw4w9WgXcQ }}\n\nPlay it, I dare you.\n\n[linkref]: https://example.org\n[hugo]: https://gohugo.io\n",
